<h1>GridView, Non-Blocking Rendering</h1>
This example shows the window with an editable GridView control that is bound to 3000 rows.<br><br>
This is not recommended for performance reasons. Instead of loading thousands of rows into the GridView at once, you should use paging.<br>
However, in cases when you absolutely need it, GridView will render rows in a non-blocking fashion.<br>
